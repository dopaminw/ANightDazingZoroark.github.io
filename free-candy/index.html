<p>From creator of free candy: I regret inventing this channel. I hope that when Borgy becomes popular enough, I wont see this in any more discord servers. It was kinda fun looking at what people would see though, and if it dos become popular somehow, I'd like to see how servers would do with the concept, and what things they'll add for more fun</p>
