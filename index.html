<h1>Welcome to my website, fellow human being</h1>

Well, I can't put much personal information since this is the internet. But what I can tell you is that I was born on April 11 2004 and I live in the Philippines. This website is basically where I upload my addons and information about them, and other weird stuff I would rather post here. Also, don't mind the clunkiness of the place as I'm still redoing the place.

<h2>Stuff you can check out</h2>
There's not much to feature here since this is just a homepage, but you can at least check out the navigation bar at the left

xo by eden:
One, two, three
Yeah, she's in love with the concept
As if we're all just how she imagined
'Cause "we're in love but just don't know it yet", huh
Well, tell me how am I supposed to see the magic?
'Cause I don't believe in it no more
But I won't tell her
'Cause I always imagined
It's easier if she thinks she won
So I'mma let her, and she said
"I don't think I love you no more
You never seem to call me lately"
Girl, I don't think you know me at all
'Cause I never thought I'd have to say this
No, I don't love you, and I never did
Look at us burning down in flames for kicks but just know
I'm not singing for your XO
I'm just singing 'cause it's over, yeah
Yeah
Came and went like the summer time
Was that a sunset or sunrise?
Looking back like "where'd the time go?"
So much for trying to keep this moving slow
'Cause I don't believe in her no more
But I remember
How we talked shit like we knew what we wanted
And I still remember what she said
"I don't think I love you no more
You never seem to call me lately"
But I don't think she knew me at all
'Cause I never thought I'd have to say this
But I'm no liar, and I never hid anything
You should have seen it coming to this just know
I'm not singing for an ex though
I'm just singing 'cause it's over, yeah, yeah
